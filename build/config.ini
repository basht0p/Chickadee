;   Chickadee is a lightweight executable designed to detect and alert
;   on potentially malicious network scans.
;
;   Written in Go and using the GoPacket library, Chickadee watches 
;   for TCP packets with the SYN flag, and triggers an alert if there
;   are (n) SYN packets received on unique ports over (t) time, from
;   the same source IP.

# Agent Name
# The agent name will be included as an identifier for any alerts
# Set this to whatever you'd like, usually the hostname

# In Windows, you need to use the InterfaceDescription property to 
# configure the correct interface.
# 
# You can use the PowerShell Cmdlet "Get-NetAdapter" to find this.

    interface         =  `Hyper-V Virtual Ethernet Adapter #3`

# Defines how many SYN packets (threshold_count) over time 
# (threshold_time) to trigger alerts, and how long to ignore that
# src IP after triggering an alert (ignore_time).
#
# Default: 30 SYNs in 5s triggers an alert - then ignore that IP for 30s
